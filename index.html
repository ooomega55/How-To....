					Step 1: Find the perfect dog
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						The perfect dog is the one that matches your type. Either friendly and relaxed or rough and aggressive, these factors impact <span>the way you and the dog feel about each other. Along with this, finding a connection with the dog will bring the owner on the right path.</span>

					Step 4: Start training sessions
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						Basic tricks a dog needs to know is sit, lie down, and give it's paw. Use treats but do not reward the dog until he or she does the trick the right way. Do these tricks daily and consistently so the dog will remember this and begin to be more loyal. <span>Also, make sure to have the dog go for walks and have it on a tight leash so they don't run away.</span>

					Step 2: Buy the basic needs
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						So now that you found the right dog, you need food, water, toys, and maybe extra things from a local pet store or PetSmart. <span>Treats are extra for when dogs do something the right way and it will be shown as a reward so be sure to grab all of these items.</span>

					Step 5: Bring dog outside
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						After a few weeks or about a month, the dog needs fresh air(the dog should be going on walks beforehand) and if the owner has a backyard, let the dog run around. If the owner does not have a backyard, take it to a park and enjoy your time with the dog.

					Step 3: Block off certain areas of your home
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						Now it depends on the type of dog and their age. If the dog is still a pup, then blocking off areas will be the smartest idea. Until it knows not to nip and it is potty-trained, you can give it the freedom after these things are completed.

					Step 6: Check on your dog and care for it
				</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p class="card-text">
						Once you start all of these processes, care for your dog and play with he or she daily. The time you put in is the reward you will receive and your dog will tell you if you did the right thing.

	    <ul class="text">
	        <li>The first two images was my old dog named Buddy.  He passed away when he was 5 years old and I will still remember how amazing of a dog he was.</li>
            <li>The next two images on steps 3 and 4 was my dog Simba.  We got him as a pup but we did not get the perfect connection the family wanted.</li>	    
            <li>The image on step 5 is my old neighbor's dogs.  The one on the right is Maya and on the Left is Kenzie.  They moved further away so we do not get a chance to see them in person.</li>	    
            <li>Lastly, this is Monti who is one of the two dogs that my other neighbors have.  The other dog not shown is Zoe.</li>
